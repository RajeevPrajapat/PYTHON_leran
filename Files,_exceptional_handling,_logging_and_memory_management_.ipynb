        "\n",
        "### 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What is logging in Python?\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### 9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Multithreading involves running multiple threads in the same process and is useful for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        "    Multiprocessing runs separate processes for concurrent execution and is suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "---\n",
        "### 10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "Helps in debugging\n",

        "---\n",
        "### 13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "- It ensures efficient use of resources, prevents memory leaks, and improves program stability and performance.\n",
        "---\n",
        "### 14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "- try contains code that might cause an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "- except defines how to handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
        "---\n",
        "### 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to reclaim memory from objects that are no longer in use.\n",
        "---\n",
        "### 16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The else block runs only if no exception was raised in the try block.\n",

        "---\n",
        " ### 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "- file.read() reads the entire file content as a single string.\n",
        "\n",
        "- file.readline() reads one line from the file at a time.\n",
        "---\n",
        "### 21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "- It provides a flexible framework to output status messages from a program to various outputs like console or files.\n",
        "---\n",
        "### 22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "- The os module helps interact with the operating system, enabling file handling tasks like deleting, renaming, and checking file existence.\n",
